## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
cd build
npx surge
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## UI Components

Find a component from [`daisyui`](https://daisyui.com), and copy paste the code into your project.

## Tailwindcss

You can decide for youself if you want to use regular css or use tailwindcss classes. Read more about tailwindcss [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).
